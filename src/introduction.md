# Introduction

Welcome to the Bluesky Community User Guide! Our goal is to provide an accessible and friendly guide to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) -- a federated microblogging platform, built on [ATProto](https://atproto.com). Don't know what either of those are? We'll explain that, too!

## Who Is This For?

Hopefully, you! Our aim is to ensure this guide is accessible to as many Bluesky users as possible, and to help demystify the technology behind the platform. Bluesky differs in many ways from both traditional, centralized, social media as well as other federated platforms such as Mastodon.
