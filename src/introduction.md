# Introduction

Welcome to the Bluesky Community User Guide! Our goal is to provide an accessible and friendly guide to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) -- a federated microblogging platform, built on [ATProto](https://atproto.com). Don't know what either of those are? We'll explain that, too!

## Who Is This For?

Hopefully, you! Our aim is to ensure this guide is accessible to as many Bluesky users as possible, and to help demystify the technology behind the platform. Bluesky differs in many ways from both traditional, centralized, social media as well as other federated platforms such as Mastodon.

## What is Bluesky?

Bluesky itself can refer to several things - the company that runs and develops the application and servers, the app itself, or even the community of users. In this guide, we'll use it to refer to the platform as it exists today -- a private beta of a microblogging service, similar to Twitter. 

> ⚠️ This [FAQ](https://blueskyweb.xyz/faq) contains more information on Bluesky the company that you may be interested in.

There are several important differences between Twitter and Bluesky, which we'll detail more in [later chapters](./users/intro.md), but there's one very important thing to remember for now - **everything on Bluesky can be read by the entire Internet**. While you can delete posts and media, there's no guarantees that someone outside of Bluesky hasn't viewed and saved it.
